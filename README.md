# Captcha-Solver
This project automates the download of electoral roll PDFs from a government website using Selenium for browser automation and CAPTCHA recognition with a Keras-based deep learning model. The project segments CAPTCHA images into individual characters, predicts them using a trained neural network, and inputs the CAPTCHA solution to continue automated downloads.
